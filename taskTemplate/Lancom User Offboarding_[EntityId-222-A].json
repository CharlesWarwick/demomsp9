Ticket account and click Delete Selected. \nNOTE: You need to log into any domains that used a MSP account and remove the user inside the AD. If all the locations were set to use MSP account as \"default\" locations, deleting from MSP would also delete from AD, but since MMC requires permissions to get an account set up we cant use the \"Default\" locations in MSP account setup area. It sucks, but it has to be done to properly offboard, otherwise the account might just stay there with the last set password and a Lancom user that has left could still have access.\nSpecifically verify and delete that the AD account is deleted from MMC AD after deleting the MSP account.
