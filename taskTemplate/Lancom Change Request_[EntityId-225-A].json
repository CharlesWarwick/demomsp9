This includes assessing required steps to make a change, assess risks, have a rollback plan should the change not go as planned and to get sign off both internally and from the customer.\n\nThe primary goal of change control process is to create a documented record of required changes to ensure each change is implemented in a correct, well thought-out manner with minimal impact or disruption to BAU.",

For example, the Extrusion machine controller for TC CHC Factory",

In these cases, please get confirmation in writing that the customer wants to bypass the change control process before proceeding with the change.\n- It is a new deployment which will have no impact on any existing systems of infrastructure",
